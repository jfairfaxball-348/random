# Phase 4 — Mathematics records

Status: **OPEN** after formal Gate-3 PASS in P3-S008.

Selected candidate: **CAND-01 — Computable randomness under finite-ambiguity observations**.

The exact formulation remains unchanged: for every fixed k>=1, consider everywhere-total computable fair-coin-preserving Cantor self-maps with at most k preimages of each point, with no effective inverse branches assumed.

### P4-S001 — k=1 injective base case

P4-S001 proves that k=1 forces a computable fair-coin-preserving homeomorphism with an everywhere-total computable inverse. SRC-0015 / THM-0038 then yields computable-randomness invariance.

The inverse has a computable use modulus for each particular map, but there is no single fixed inverse-use bound across the whole class; coordinate permutations witness arbitrarily delayed inverse use.

This is programme mathematics, not a novelty result. PA-0001 remains **UNRESOLVED_UNDER_INSPECTED_EVIDENCE**. The Gate-3 no-consequence guard is preserved as the pre-Phase-4 baseline. P4-S001 establishes only k=1; k>=2 and general finite multiplicity remain unresolved here.

Publication remains CLOSED. Fairfax-Ball Randomness is not defined.
